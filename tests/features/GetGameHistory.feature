Feature: Get game history information

  As a customer,
  I would like to retrieve my game history,
  so that I can view my list of played games.

#  Background:
#    Given I am logged in as a regular user with username "username123" and email "user@email.com"
#
#  Scenario: Retrieve user game history (Normal Flow)
#    When I make a GET request to "http://localhost:8000/users/game/history"
#    Then the response status code should be 200
#    And the response should contain a status message "Success"
#    And the response should display my game history
#
#  Scenario: Retrieve user details using a valid username (Alternate Flow)
#    When I make a GET request to "http://localhost:8000/users/user" with username "username123"
#    Then the response status code should be 200
#    And the response should contain a status message "Success"
#    And the response should contain my user details for the username "username123"
